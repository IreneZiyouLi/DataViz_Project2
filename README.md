# Data Visualization Crituque by Design 

## Section 1: Background (what & why this visualization):
This visualization is found at [climate.gov](https://www.climate.gov/media/14605). It is used in the article [Climate Change: Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) to illustrate that the carbon dioxide level had reached a level that had never beeen attained over the past 800,000 years.

## Section 2: Critiques

### Overall obeservations about this data visualization:
1. Stood out to me: the first information I caught is that the line chart shows that the number fluctuated a lot within a specific range over time. Then I was attracted by the text saying "highest previous concentration". 
2. What I found worked well: the four text explanations on the graph help the audience to better understand the data as they provide the specific events explaining the level of CO2 at the specific time. 
3. What didn't work well: based on the topic of the article and its surrounding explanation, the main goal of this visualization is to show how current concentration is much higher than any historical level. However, the point of current concentration on the chart doesn't stand out, neither by color nor size. Moreover, the point is not connected to the trend line, leaving it unclear about whether 2021 is a spike or it had been a problem for years. Therefore, important information is missing from this visualization as well. 
4. What I will do differently: As I just mentioned, I would like to make the line continuous, meaning eliminating the gap between the current concentration point and other data shown in the line. That would answer the question raised above. More importantly, I would use a more eye-catching color (dark red, for example) for the current concentration 2021 average. 

### Define the audience of the visualization and evaluate the effectiveness accordingly
The audience of this graph, in my opinion, is the general populations including a wide range of demographic group with the purpose of drawing attention on climate change related to carbon dioxide emissions. More specifically, its purpose is to show how (sadly) surprising the current global CO2 level is compared to historical records. Although the chart is easily interpretable by general public (meaning there isn't much unfamiliar/unclear information provided), this visualization is not effective in terms of conveying its main idea as the "current concentration" is not the striking point (even worser, people could easily miss that point with a fast reading). 


### Comments on Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile
Overall, this method helps me effectively identify the problems/area of improvement of the visualization by thinking through each of the metrics. For example, I didn't really there is a problem with missing data until I thought about the rating for completeness. If there is anything (metric) I would add to this evaluation method, I would add a metric to evaluate if the same main idea could be perceived by different demographics when they look at the visualization. I think this metric is important, especially to this visualization, because too many highlighting (eye-catching) points on a visualization could be interpreted differently based on area of interest/familiarity. For example, people who are interested in history might be attracted by "ice age" noted on the graph rather than climate change, which definitely is not the purpose of this visualization.
